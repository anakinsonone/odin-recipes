  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy
    and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your
    stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan,
    resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of
    the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese casserole with
    grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a salad for a
    meatless dinner.
